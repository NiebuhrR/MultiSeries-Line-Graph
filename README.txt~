The full list of codes that we borrow for our project is as followed:

multiseries line graph: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955
mouseover line effect: https://bl.ocks.org/larsenmtl/e3b8b7c2ca4787f77d78f58d41c3da91
nesting data: http://learnjsdata.com/group_data.html 

For the multiseries line graph, adapting mbostock's code is fairly straightforward,
the most challenging part is understanding how d3 nesting works, and how to data's keys
or objects within values after nesting. We found that it is really helpful to group
the lines and axes into smaller groups, which makes updating easier, rather than
directly adding everything to the svg. 

For the drop down menu, we adapt Murray's codes from class. This is fairly familiar 
given past assignment; the only thing worth noting is to be mindful of which elements
or effects need to be removed for updating. This process is much easier when we have
groups of elements, rather than adding everything to the svg as previously discussed.

For the mouseover line effect of the multiseries line chart, note that it is possible 
to have tracing for multiple lines. Instead of looping over all the lines like the 
sample code (provided by larsenmtl), we changed lines[i] to lines[0] because we only
want to examine the closing price of each stock.
